            In Western astrology, astrological signs are the twelve 30 degree sectors that make up Earth's 360 degree orbit around the Sun. 
            The signs enumerate from the first day of spring known as the First Point of Aries which is the vernal equinox. 
            The Western astrological signs are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.
            The Western zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by Hellenistic culture. Each sign was named after a constellation 
            the sun annually moved through while crossing the sky. This observation is emphasized in the simplified and popular sun sign astrology. Over the centuries, Western astrology's 
            zodiacal divisions have shifted out of alignment with 
            the constellations they were named after by axial precession[1] while Hindu 
            astrology measurements correct for shifting.[2]Astrology has developed in Chinese and Tibetan cultures as well.
